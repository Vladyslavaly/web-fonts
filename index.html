                    <p class="p">React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and<br> 
                    the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs<br>
                    APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <span class="core_components">bundles<br> 
                    of reusable, nestable code.</span> You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover<br>
                    how components work in React Native.</p>

                    <h2 class="head">REACT FUNDAMENTALS <span class="chapter-number"><sup class="super">Chapter 3</sup></span></h2>
                    <p class="p">React Native runs on <a href="https://ru.legacy.reactjs.org" target="_blank" class="black-link">React</a>, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with<br> 
                    JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get<br> 
                    you started or can serve as a refresher course.</p>
                    <p class="p">We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                    <p class="p"><span class="text-bold">+components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable<br> 
                    creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>
                    <p class="p"><span class="text-bold">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:<br> 
                    <span class="gray-text">&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</span>.</p>
                    <p class="p">The React docs have <a href=" https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html" target="_blank" class="black-link">a comprehensive guide to JSX</a> you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is<br> 
                    JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span class="gray-text">name</span> for the cat, name, and<br> 
                    embedding it with curly braces inside <span class="gray-text">&lt;Text&gt;</span></p>
                    <p class="p"><span class="text-bold">+ props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</p>
                    <p class="p"><span class="text-bold">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render,<br> 
                    state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over<br> 
                    time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!</p>

                    <div><h2 class="head">HANDLING TEXT INPUT <span class="chapter-number"><sup class="super">Chapter 4</sup></span></h2></div>
                   
                    <p class="p">TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <span class="core_components">onChangeText</span> prop that<br> 
                    takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a<br> 
                    function to be called when the text is submitted.</p>
                    <p class="p">For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language.<br> 
                    In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there<br> 
                    Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
